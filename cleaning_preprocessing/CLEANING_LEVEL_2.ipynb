    "1. `New_used` : Name of this col should be changed to `Stock Type`\n",
    "2. `Car Name` : Car_name col contains info of manufacture Year, and some detailed name of car, which should be splitted into diff cols.\n",
    "3. `Mileage` : suffix mi. should be removed so that we can convert mileage to number.\n",
    "4. `Price` : Since all cars are listed in USD,the suffix '$' should be removed and widespace should also be removed, so that we can convert it to numeric format.\n",
    "5. `Price Drop` : Widespace and suffix price drop should be removed.\n",
    "6. `Deal_type` : Sometimes contains a price (which is EMI val), which should be splitted into two cols and widespace need to be removed.\n",
    "7. `Key_specs`,`Basics`,`Other_features`,`Vehicle_history` : These colunm need to be removed, because we expanded this col, but kept if need in future, after all the cleaning process.\n",
    "8. `Exterior_color` : This col sometimes contains color code (numbers) which need to be converted back to color name.\n",
    "9. `Interior_color` : col sometimes contains '-' to show null value and color code that need to be converted back to color name.\n",
    "10. `Drivetrain` : suffix '-wheel Drive' & widespaces should be removed.\n",
    "11. `MPG` : contains unnecessary text. \n",
    "12. `Fuel_Type` : contains '-' to show null values.\n",
    "13. `Transmission` : need to remove widespaces.\n",
    "14. `Engine` : contains some specific info about the engine, need to be cleaned with domain knowledge.\n",
    "15. `VIN`,`Stock_no`,`Accidents_or_damage`,`Clean_title`,`one_owner_vehicle`,`Personal_use_only`,`Open_recall`,`seller_name`,`seller_rating`,`seller_site`,`car_rating`, : seems good.\n",
    "16. `Mileage` : it is duplicate col and need to be deleted.\n",
    "17. `Convenience`,`Entertainment`,`Exterior`,`Safety`,`Seating` : contains multiple info need to further splitted into more cols.\n",
    "18. `Fuel_Type_e` : contains only one value which is electric, hence need to be merged with Fuel_Type col.\n",
    "19. `mpge` : is used only in electric cars, will see after domain knowledge whether we can merge it with mpg col.\n",
    "20. `level2_charging`,`dc_fast_charging` : suffix hrs and widespace need to be removed.\n",
    "21. `battery_capacity` : suffix kWh & widespaces need to be removed.\n",
    "22. `excepted_range` : need to remove mi and widespace and with domain knowledge, will try to convert hyphened value a single number.\n",
    "23. `battery_range_score` : contains 2 info, need to be splitted into 2 cols\n",
    "24. `people_count_seller_rating`,`people_count_car_rating` : need to remove widespace, brackets and suffix reviews.\n",
    "25. `seller_address` : need to be splitted into city, state, ZIP code and shop number."
